<h1> SQL Solutions Danny's Diner Dataset </h1>
</div>

**<div align='center'> Problem Statement </div>**


Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

- sales

- menu

- members

You can inspect the entity relationship diagram and example data below.

**<div align='center'> Case Study Questions </div>**

Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement:

- What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

- How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

- What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

- Which item was the most popular for each customer?

- Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

- Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?

- What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

- If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?

- In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
